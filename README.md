🚍 Bus Reservation System – Mini Project
This is a Python + MySQL-based Bus Reservation System developed as a mini project. The system allows users to book bus tickets with a graphical interface, select specific seats, and view available seats in real-time.

✅ Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with gender identification.

Graphical Seat Selection: 2x2 seat layout with a central aisle, showing available, booked, and female-reserved seats.

Female-Only Seat Logic: Seats booked by female users are marked separately. Only female users can book seats adjacent to these for added safety.

Driver Seat Highlighting: Driver's seat is clearly indicated in the interface.

Multiple Ticket Booking: Users can select and book multiple seats in a single transaction.

MySQL Integration: Robust database for storing user data, bookings, and seat availability.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python (Tkinter for GUI)

MySQL (Backend database)

bcrypt (for secure password hashing)

SQL connector (mysql-connector-python)

📌 Future Scope:

Admin panel for bus and route management

Online payment integration

Email/SMS confirmation for bookings

College-specific customization for campus buses
